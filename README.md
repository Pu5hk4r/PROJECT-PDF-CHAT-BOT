# PROJECT: PDF CHATBOT

The **PDF Chatbot** is an AI-powered application that allows users to interact with PDF documents using natural language. It processes PDF files, extracts their content, and leverages a language model to provide context-aware responses to user queries about the document.

## **Project Workflow**

1. **File Upload**:
   - Users upload a PDF file via the Gradio interface.

2. **PDF Parsing**:
   - The system extracts text and metadata using **PyPDF2**.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - The user inputs questions about the document.
   - The chatbot processes the query using **LangChain** and a language model (e.g., GPT-based).

4. **Response Generation**:
   - The chatbot generates accurate and context-aware responses to the userâ€™s questions.

5. **Output Display**:
   - Responses are displayed in the Gradio interface.
